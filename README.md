# Overview:
If the list view from the normal version of this mod doesn't strike your fancy, this version very well might. This version emulates the slots from the default spell selection, and arranges them in such a way that all spells will be visible at once. This is useful for players who are irritated by the lack of visibility in the default spell selection.
