<b class="Bold"> Update v4.0 brings support for game versions v2.6.6.0+. EEex is currently required to use this mod. Note that EEex is only available on Windows platforms as of the time of writing.</b>

<h1>Overview:</h1>

This mod seeks to replace the standard actionbar spell selection with an alternative that is more convenient for the player. The primary enhancements over the default spell selection include:
<ul>
<li> Displaying all available spells at once, (categorized by level). No more endlessly clicking the right-arrow to get to your 9th level spells!
<li> A searchable spell list. Know which spell you want to cast? Just type the first couple of characters and press enter.
<li> The ability to narrow view to only Mage or Cleric spells; useful for Mage/Clerics.
</ul>
